Type of opponent or partner &

{
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}[t]{@{}X@{}}
    People play more vigorously against a computer opponent than alone \cite{Mcwha_2009,Feltz2011BuddyGames,Feltz2014CyberExergames,Samendinger2017IntroductoryPartners,Feltz2012TwoPlayerActivity,Staiano2011WiiExpenditure}\\
People play more vigorously with a human opponent than with a computer \cite{Feltz2014CyberExergames,ODonovan2012EnergyModes,Verhoeven2015EnergyEnjoyment,Kooiman2016ExergamingEducation}\\
Except one study, with less exercise when humans cooperated in a shared physical space than single player \cite{Peng2013PlayingExertion}.\\
People perceive less effort for similar exertion in multiplayer modes \cite{Lisn2015CompetitiveAdolescents}, and self reported motivation is higher \cite{Peng2013PlayingExertion}.  

\end{tabularx}}
\\
How other players behave & 
{
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}[t]{@{}X@{}}
    One study found that players use more energy when they play cooperatively than competitively, especially when playing with friends. \cite{Peng2012TheGame}.\\
    Whilst another found that local co-op play was lower intensity than remote competitive play \cite{Peng2013PlayingExertion}.\\
    People are more active when their opponent is slightly better than them (rather than worse, or a lot better)\cite{Feltz2012TwoPlayerActivity}\\
    If a virtual exercise \textbf{partner} gives you encouragement in the form of "you" statements, it decreases performance compared to a silent partner.\cite{Max_2016}\\
    If a virtual exercise \textbf{trainer} gives you encouragement in the form of "you" statements as you exercise alone, it increases performance.\cite{Max_2016}
    
\end{tabularx}}
\\
How games are framed
& {
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}[t]{@{}X@{}}
    People do more exercise in fitness themed games than entertainment themed games \cite{Chen2014HealthifyingPriming,Monedero2017EnergyExercise,Lyons2012NovelGames}.\\
    But people enjoy entertainment games more \cite{Lyons2012NovelGames}\\
    Players moved more when narrative cutscenes were added to Wii Sports \cite{Lu2016TheStudy}\\
    Players move less if avatars in games are obese \cite{Pea2016IExergames,Pea2014IncreasingAppearance,Li2014WiiExergames}\\
    Players with low body image dissatisfaction preferred to see their image on screen and vice versa.\cite{Song2011PromotingExergame}
    
\end{tabularx}}
\\

Choice of game or play style
& {
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}[t]{@{}X@{}}
    People exercise harder when playing a variety of games, compared to a single game \cite{Raynor2016EffectActivity}.\\
    Strong preferences for lower effort games \cite{Bissell2016EffectivenessActivity}.\\
    More exercise in the same game standing than seated \cite{sanders2014physiologic}\\
    People exercise harder when they find games: more engaging, enjoyable, or if the physical actions are `realistic' \cite{Lyons2014EngagementPlay,Lin2015TheGames}

\end{tabularx}}
\\
Adaptiveness and Skill	
& {
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}[t]{@{}X@{}}
Games that track heart rates can encourage players to push themselves harder or reach target heart rates \cite{Ketcheson2015DesigningExergames,Sinclair2009ExergameModel}.\\
Games which adapt to player fitness levels increase enjoyment and motivation	\cite{MartinNiedecken2017GoPlanet}\\
	Games that exaggerate player's physical abilities are more enjoyable than those that present realistic depictions	\cite{Kajastila2014EmpoweringGame}\\
