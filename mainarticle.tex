\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
\IEEEPARstart{E}{xertion} games are games in which the core play activities require the players to exercise. Academic interest in such games began when researchers observed the amount of exercise demonstrated by players of the arcade game Dance Dance Revolution \cite{tan2002aerobic}. Academics and commercial game developers have since designed a wide range of games that deliberately encourage participants to exercise. Some such as Wii Fit, have been extremely commercially successful.

Beyond their entertaining qualities, exertion games are often presented as health interventions, targeting for example  childhood sedentary behaviour and obesity \cite{marshall2017misrepresentation}. For games to positively affect health via exercise, 3 things must be true \cite{Dutta2015EffectsReview}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exertion games must encourage sufficient exercise levels in the short-term to have positive health effects.
    \item People must choose or be encouraged to play over the long time periods required to achieve health effects.
    \item Opportunity costs of exertion games must not outweigh any direct health benefits. For example, money spent on games may replace exercise equipment, or time spent playing may replace time spent doing sports activities with better evidenced health benefits \cite{Dutta2015EffectsReview}.
\end{enumerate}
In this article we produce a scoping literature review \cite{arksey2005scoping} of empirical studies addressing the first of these questions. 

\section{Background}

\subsection{What are exertion games and why are people excited?}

We define exertion games as games that require energetic movement to play. Examples of such games include fitness focused games that deliberately aim to induce exercise, such as the Wii Fit series (Nintendo, 2007-2014), and Xbox Fitness (Microsoft, 2013-201), along with full body movement games not framed as 'exercise games', such as Dance Dance Revolution (Konami, 1998-2016), Wii Sports (Nintendo, 2006-2018), Kinect Adventures / Sports (Microsoft, 2010-2014).  

Many commentators have suggested that exertion games could help address identified health problems, such as the perceived low levels of physical activity in children, and increased obesity levels in many populations \cite{marshall2017misrepresentation}. Such research often takes the view that people already play games frequently, and that choosing to play exertion games instead of sedentary games would lead to health benefits. 

\subsection{What do existing reviews say?}

We are not the first researchers to review existing evidence for exertion games as health interventions. Below, we summarise the reviews that have examined the short-term exercise effects of exertion games. 

Firstly, we found three meta reviews. The first considered 18 studies and found exertion games caused higher heart rates and oxygen consumption than rest \cite{Peng_2011}, and that exertion games were similar in exertion level to exercise controls. Lower body exertion games encouraged more energy expenditure than upper body games. Two other reviews considered exertion game exercise levels, one finding an average level of only light exercise from 15 studies \cite{Dutta2015EffectsReview}, and a second review of 9 studies \cite{barnett2011active}, showing that these exertion games elicited moderate levels of exercise as recommended by public health organisations. We also found a range of systematic reviews, which considered from 9 to 52 studies in total and had variable results (see  Table \ref{tab:reviewofreviews} for a summary of these studies).

\subsection{Going beyond the existing meta reviews}

Existing reviews have reached widely differing conclusions, for example one review concludes that exertion games are too low intensity to count towards public health goals for exercise \cite{Peng2013UsingResearch}, whilst another suggests that exertion games do in fact induce enough exercise to meet such goals \cite{Sween2014TheReview}. 

The reason for the disparity in these results across reviews is the poorly defined nature of the question being asked. We argue that the answer to the question 'are games exercise?' is so clearly contingent on the nature of the game being played, the context in which it is played and characteristics of the group playing the game, that one cannot review exergaming as a single entity. Combining results in meta reviews, to come to conclusions such as 'overall metabolic equivalent associated with AVG play was 2.62'\cite{Dutta2015EffectsReview}, is lacking in meaning when, as we see in our review, this can mask a range from extremely light to very vigorous exercise. We also believe that because games are diverse, a review which uses highly rigorous selection criteria will inevitably lead to a small sample of the possible research on exertion games, and a different sample to those in other reviews - indeed in Parisod et al's 'review of reviews' in this area\cite{Parisod2014PromotingReviews}, we see that the vast majority of studies included in any of the 15 reviews they consider are only included in 1 review, with each study considering a completely different subset of the literature. Instead, we deliberately use highly inclusive selection criteria, to present a broader picture of the wide range of existing research results relating to these games, and do not simply aggregate what is clearly a highly heterogenous set of results. 

\section{Data gathering}

We performed a four step scoping review based on the process described in Arksey & O'Malley \cite{arksey2005scoping}, first piloting to identify the research questions of interest and inclusion criteria, then a search to find all potentially relevant studies, followed by a screening process to narrow down to a set of relevant papers. Figure \ref{fig:flowchart} shows this process. J.M. carried out initial searches, and both authors independently performed initial exclusion and filtering of papers.

We first carried out a pilot study, by searching Google Scholar (on 03 April 2017) for the terms identified at the top of Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}. Relevant papers were inductively categorised based on the research question they attempted to answer. Through this process, we identified five separate categories, which are illustrated at the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}. 

On 18 Jan 2018 we carried out full searches in scopus, pubmed and google scholar for search terms shown in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}.  Duplicates were removed. We selected articles using the following inclusion criteria: i) In English, ii) About exertion games, iii) Primary literature describing a study, iv) The study captures data relating to physical activity or health (e.g. we excluded papers that tested accuracy of exertion game gesture recognition), v) In a peer reviewed venue.

We identified a total of 726 exertion game articles, and deductively assigned these into the 5 categories established in the pilot study (see Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}). 243 studies were identified that considered short term exercise effects of exertion games.  

\section{Results}

We further split the analysis of short term effects of exertion games into discussion of four questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How much exercise do exertion games encourage (i.e. quantitative measurements of exercise intensity)?
    \item How do exertion games compare to other forms of exertion (both in terms of exercise amount and enjoyment, immersion, perceived level of exertion etc.)
    \item How do different features of exertion games alter participant exercise levels and experience?
    \item How do different user groups experience exertion games differently?
\end{itemize}



\subsection{How much exercise do exertion games encourage?}

We considered all studies which took an absolute measure of exercise intensity in one or more identified exertion game. We extracted the mean intensity of exertion and converted to Metabolic Equivalent of Task ( $1~MET= \frac{1~kcal}{ kg \cdot h} = \frac{3.5~ml~O_2}{ kg \cdot h}  $)\cite{jette1990metabolic}. For some  articles, this was not possible, as they used energy expenditure or VO2 without normalising for weight (e.g.\cite{Gribbon2015ActiveTrial}), or measures such as minutes above an HR threshold \cite{MacIntosh2017BalancingIii} or activity counts \cite{McDougall2008ChildrenStudy}. In Figure \ref{tab:METs}, we plot 207 data points from the 48 articles which met these criteria. Each point is a measurement of mean MET for an individual game. Of these, 94 measurements were below 3 METs, so did not achieve moderate levels of exercise. 92 achieved moderate activity ( 3-6 METs), and 20 achieved vigorous activity (\textgreater 6 METs).
  
\begin{table}
\setlength{\abovecaptionskip}{0pt}
\vspace{-4mm}
\caption{Graph of metabolic rates observed in exertion game studies.}
\input{metgraph}
\label{tab:METs}
\end{table}

World Health Organisation \cite{world2010global}, USA \cite{usguidelines2018} and \cite{ukguidelines2011} British recommendations for adults all prescribe at least 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise (3-6 METs) per week or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise (6+ METs). For children, they also prescribe 3 sessions/week of vigorous activity (e.g. jogging). Only 20 measurements (9.8\% of results) showed vigorous exercise. Further, whilst exertion games may contribute to fulfilling recommendations through moderate exercise, in almost 45\% of studies, people did not even reach moderate levels. If people in optimum conditions of academic health labs, doing studies about exercise, whilst wearing exercise measurement equipment, do not exercise hard enough, it is not strong support for use of exertion games as a health intervention, as others have noted, for example Scheer et al. conclude that \enquote{Overall, playing a “physically active” home video game system does not meet the minimal threshold for moderate intensity physical activity, regardless of gaming system\cite{scheer2014wii}}. 

Strong results for some specific games suggest that extreme variance in results is dependent on game design, for example dance games almost all achieve moderate exercise in our results, and as Fawkner et al. \cite{Fawkner2010AdolescentGaming} note, may offer real potential for exercise particularly in specific at-risk groups such as adolescent girls. 

The wide ranges of measurements for popular games, highlight that exertion may vary strongly based on chosen difficulty levels, skill or other factors. This shows that exertion games can be effective exercise if played in the right way, but that how the game is played can vastly alter intensity of exercise.

%Whilst there is increasing amounts of evidence that purely anti-sedentary behaviour such as taking breaks from sitting can have positive health benefits, if we are to make games which specifically encourage exercise, rather than just to encourage 

\subsection{How do games compare to other forms of exercise?}

It is clear that exertion games have the potential function as useful exercise activities. A second question commonly addressed by research is how they compare to other forms of exercise. This work explores whether games have the potential to make exercise more enjoyable, or to encourage people to exercise harder, perhaps by distracting them from how hard they are working. Results are shown in tables \ref{tab:gamevsexercise} and \ref{tab:enjoyment}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Measured Activity Level in Exertion Games versus Traditional Exercise Activities}
\label{tab:gamevsexercise}
\centering
\input{gamevsexercise}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\caption{Differences in Enjoyment and Perceived Effort Between Exertion Games and Exercise}
\label{tab:enjoyment}
\centering

\input{enjoymentvsexercise}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:gamevsexercise} shows comparisons in 60 studies in our dataset, between games and traditional forms of exercise in terms of whether measured activity levels were greater or lower in the exertion game compared to the exercise. Positive (20), negative (18) and even (19) comparisons between game and exercise are roughly balanced. In particular, compared to walking on a treadmill, or gently riding a stationary bicycle, exertion games in many cases can at least equal the intensity of exercise. 

However, one major criticism of this body of work is exactly the comparison described above; that the vast majority of these studies compare exertion gaming to walking on a treadmill or cycling on a stationary bike, often with no other stimulation. These control conditions arguably flatter exertion games in that they are comparing against the most monotonous and simple forms of exercise, performed at low intensity. In contrast, studies comparing gaming to instructor led aerobic dance \cite{Gao2013ChildrenSDance,eason2016comparison}, climbing exercises \cite{Sell2011EnergyActivities} and Irish dance lessons \cite{Rincker2017TheFitness} all found exertion games produced less physical activity. 

Beyond intensity, Table \ref{tab:enjoyment} lists significant differences observed in relation to enjoyment and/or perceived exertion. We can see from this table that compared to control conditions, games were seen as more enjoyable than the exercise controls, although this was not always in tandem with greater physical activity. There is also some evidence \cite{Haddock_2009,Monedero2015InteractiveAdults,Devereaux2012ComparisonExercise} that players may perceive effort as relatively lower during exertion game play compared to non-distracting control conditions. However, again these control conditions were largely uninteresting treadmill or stationary cycling exercises, which limits the ecological validity of these results. Interestingly, where aerobic dance classes were compared with dance games, one study found that children enjoyed the games more \cite{Gao2013ChildrenSDance}, whereas another study found that adults preferred instructor led fitness lessons \cite{eason2016comparison}. 

One key finding is that games which simulate exercise activities, such as Wii Tennis, are different to the underlying exercise activities. One interesting study compares the specifics of this difference in relation to rock climbing games \cite{Jenny2015VirtualPerceptions}, showing that while climbing games do not teach the same movement skills, they did however require similar tactical skills to real climbing, so could potentially aid in that element of skill development.

\subsection{How do different features of exertion games alter participant exercise levels and experience?}

In this section, we discuss research which investigates how different features of exertion games (33 papers) affect game play, exercise and player experience. We break these down thematically rather than providing an exhaustive list of studies, as typically multiple studies examine the same game features, and results are more nuanced than the pure between-group comparisons of exertion level or enjoyment described in the previous sections. Table \ref{tab:features} shows these results.

\begin{table}
\caption{Effect of Different Features of Exertion Games}
\label{tab:features}
\centering
\input{featuredifferences}
\end{table}

These articles demonstrate that a range of factors affect how people exercised in games. One key factor is multiplayer modes - with multiple studies showing that people exercised more vigorously when playing against an opponent, and yet more vigorously when against a human opponent than against a computer. One interesting study found, in contrast, that humans playing Kinect in a limited shared space, exercised less hard than in single player modes, presumably due to space constraints \cite{Peng2013PlayingExertion}. Multiplayer modes also engendered reduced perceived effort and greater motivation in participants. 

The type of multiplayer mode and partner behaviour also affects exertion. On competitive vs cooperative play, results are currently unclear, with one study \cite{Peng2012TheGame} reporting that participants use more energy playing  cooperatively than competitively, whilst another by the same authors showed less effort in local cooperative play versus remote competitive play \cite{Peng2013PlayingExertion}. 

Studies with virtual partners have also demonstrated the Köhler effect \cite{witte1989kohler}, a well known effect in which performance is highest when a virtual exercise partner is manipulated to be just slightly better than the player, rather than worse or a lot better \cite{Feltz2012TwoPlayerActivity}. Similarly, how a virtual character talks to the player, and the role of that character can also affect exercise performance, with one study showing that if exercise \textit{partners}, who are also shown to be exercising, give encouragement such as "You can do it", this actually decreases performance, whereas if a non-exercising exercise \textit{trainer} encourages players similarly, performance is increased \cite{Max_2016}.

Another feature that can affect games is how the games are framed. Multiple studies have shown that players do more exercise during games that are themed as exercise games than entertainment, but enjoy the exercise games less. However effects have also been demonstrated with even simple cosmetic manipulations such as making avatars obese (which reduced exercise performance \cite{Pea2016IExergames,Pea2014IncreasingAppearance,Li2014WiiExergames} ), or adding narrative cutscenes to a game (which increased exercise performance \cite{Lu2016TheStudy} ).

Studies found that giving people choices from a variety of games encourages more exercise compared to giving them a single game \cite{Raynor2016EffectActivity}, although when given such choices, players preferred games that are less effort to play \cite{Bissell2016EffectivenessActivity}. People were found to exercise harder with games they found more engaging or enjoyable, but also in games that were felt to be more realistic \cite{Lyons2014EngagementPlay,Lin2015TheGames}. One way in which such enjoyment and engagement could be found was in games that adapted well to player fitness levels or heart rate; another study showed that providing exaggerated representations of player's physical abilities also increased enjoyment \cite{Kajastila2014EmpoweringGame}.

These articles show that a wide range of exertion game features affect the heavily interlinked factors of how people exercise and how enjoyable or motivating they find games. Many factors are not even directly about gameplay, such as visual framing, the presented purpose or theme of the game, the variety of choice of games, and who or what a person is playing the game with. 

\subsection{How do different user groups experience exertion games differently?}

\begin{table}
\caption{Ages of Study Participants}
\label{tab:demographics}
\centering
\input{demographics.tex}
\end{table}

One clear limitation of exertion gaming research relating to exercise levels is that the vast majority of work has been done on children or college age adults. Table \ref{tab:demographics} shows the ages of study participants in our dataset (n.b. only reviewing articles relating to short term exercise - a large amount of work has been done in relation to rehab and balance in the elderly [REF]). Younger people are well known to exercise more \cite{bhf_2015},  there is limited evidence as to the effects of exertion games particularly on middle aged adults, who are likely to do less exercise in general.  

Whilst we can say little about adults of different ages, we did find a range of research which compares how paired groups of users grouped by personal characteristics play exertion games (19 papers). This work is summarized in Table \ref{tab:groups}. 

\begin{table}
\caption{How Different Player Groups Experience Exertion Games}
\label{tab:groups}
\centering
\input{groupdifferences}
\end{table}

Multiple studies \cite{Clevenger2015EnergyKinect,McNarry2016InvestigatingChildren,Lam2011PlayAlternatives} (although not all \cite{Lin2015TheGames}) found that male players exercised harder in exertion games. This fits with known disparities in levels of exercise across genders (e.g. \cite{te2007patterns}). However, we note that some studies - particularly those focusing on dancing games - did find exergame-related increases in exercise for adolescent girls \cite{Fawkner2010AdolescentGaming}.

Weight status also showed effects on how people played exertion games, although, as can be seen in Table \ref{tab:groups}, results of weight status are highly varied, with overweight groups using more, the same, or less energy (normalised for weight), than normal weight participants. Whilst this research has yet to provide clear answers, it is clear that to be effective with a range of participants,  game design and testing must take into account the need of those with differing weight status.

Health status also appears to have mixed results on gameplay, but shows some evidence that health conditions such as stroke may reduce intensity of play.

Finally, research has considered the effect of player skill on gaming intensity. This seems highly game specific - for example in Dance Dance Revolution, high skilled players can dance faster and were more active than other players; whereas in Neverball \cite{Berkovsky2012PhysicalReward} and Kinect Michael Phelps Swimming \cite{Soltani2017PhysiologicalExperience}, players who were more skilled at the game were able to do less exercise. 

Another point worth noting is that skill in exertion games often doesn't map to the actual exercise that is being simulated. For example, participants level of swimming skill is not correlated with performance in a swimming exertion game \cite{Soltani2017PhysiologicalExperience}. This finding could be explained by the motions required in the game being different to real swimming, similar to the climbing games discussed above \cite{Jenny2015VirtualPerceptions}.

\section{Conclusion and Key Lessons}

The sometimes unspoken hypothesis of exertion games is simple and appears intuitive - if we make games that encourage people to move, they will do exercise, and reap the same health benefits that regular exercise is known to provide, thus helping people meet public health recommendations for exercise. This paper demonstrates that the reality is far more complicated; clearly exertion game play can encourage exercise to levels that meet public health recommendations. But even in lab settings, many games did not encourage even moderate levels of exercise. It is clearly far more complicated than assuming that if one builds a game which encourages people to move, they will move when they play it, and that movement will reach recommended intensity levels. This body of research leads to three key lessons for researchers in the area:

\subsection{Context is important}
Doing exercise is clearly a complex social behaviour that involves far more than the moment of exercise itself. We can see from the massive variation in results for games which were studied multiple times, such as Wii Boxing and Dance Dance Revolution, that it is hard to say that any specific game always encourages exercise. Whilst there are clear patterns here, as observed in previous research \cite{Peng_2011} that lower body games such as dance games lead to higher typical exertion levels, even within such games we see ranges from less than 3 METs exertion to greater than 6. Clearly, the level of exercise may be affected by many factors such as participant characteristics and skill level, difficulty level choices, and experimental conditions such as instructions given, time structure of experiments, what other activities were done in the experiment, what display was used etc. As such, given the fact that in real-world settings, people typically have control over their game systems, and a choice as to whether to play the game and how hard to play, it is hard to argue that the existing body of evidence demonstrates that an exertion game is superior to for example a ball, or other simple piece of exercise equipment. 

One key target context of exertion games is schools; in this context, where a level of coercion exists, and settings are more controlled, there is some promise, with one study \cite{Gao2015AExergaming} showing increased exertion levels in exertion gaming versus standard physical education lessons. However, the children in this study also achieved similarly increased levels of exertion in free play at recess, so again it shows little evidence of advance over simply letting children free to run outside.

\subsection{Exercise is more than exertion}

A fundamental point which is missing in measurement of exertion games purely by the quantity of exertion performed, is the wider purposes of exercise. For example, whilst school physical education may use less energy than some exertion games \cite{Gao2015AExergaming}, that may have been because those lessons were also teaching children valuable skills that they may take forward into a lifetime of doing exercise, a benefit that may not be equally present in exertion games. Similarly, whilst most work focuses on aerobic exercise, and many papers reference WHO recommendations of 150 minutes moderate exercise per week, few discuss accompanying recommendations for strength training. 
In addition to this, specifically in interventions targeted at adults, there is increasing evidence that reducing prolonged sedentary behaviour may have strong positive effects independent of quantity of moderate to vigorous exercise (e.g.\cite{healy2008objectively}). As such, regular getting up and moving may be more important than intensity - meaning that studying ongoing regular engagement will be more important in such cases. We caution, however, that in children a previous review showed that negative effects of sedentary behaviour were not found when exercise levels were controlled for \cite{cliff2016objectively}.

\subsection{We need to consider realistic alternatives to exertion games}

When designing comparative studies of exertion games, we suggest that rather than compare against trivial and monotonous (but easily arranged) comparison conditions, such as treadmill walking or gentle exercise biking, researchers should use realistic comparisons, such as more entertaining sporting activities. It is important to remember that our studies may be used to promote the use of exertion games as alternatives to existing exercise activities. The data shows that only 10\% of studies reported vigorous activity levels from exertion games \cite{Chaput2013ActiveYouth}, showing that such games are not yet equivalent to more intense sports. We can see this in the few studies in our dataset that compare exertion games against non-monotonous forms of exercise \cite{Gao2013ChildrenSDance,Rincker2017TheFitness,Sell2011EnergyActivities}, which showed greater activity levels in traditional exercises versus exertion games.

Furthermore, the fact that context is so important suggests that for games to have genuine health benefits, they will need to be part of a structured and supported intervention. Such structures are likely to have added costs, over and above hardware and software for games themselves. As such, when considering the potential benefit of exertion games, it is important to consider the total cost of providing the intervention and game in comparison to the costs of other interventions such as instructor led exercise which may lead to greater exercise and social benefits.
